# Hello I'm Ibraheem!

### Mechatronics Engineer | Driven by Curiosity | Intrested in Robotics 

I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Glasgow, passionate about transforming complex engineering challenges into integrated systems. I achieve this by using my skills in C++ and Python programming, combined with skills in Cadence (OrCAD, PSpice) for  electrical design and Autodesk Fusion 360/Inventor for mechanical solutions.
