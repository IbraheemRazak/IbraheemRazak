# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ibraheem!

### ðŸ¤– Mechatronics Engineer | Driven by Curiosity | Intrested in Robotics 

I'm a second-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Glasgow, passionate about transforming complex engineering challenges into robust, integrated systems. I achieve this by leveraging my skills in C++ and Python programming, combined with expertise in Cadence (OrCAD, Allegro, PSpice) for comprehensive electrical design and Autodesk Fusion 360/Inventor for mechanical solutions.
